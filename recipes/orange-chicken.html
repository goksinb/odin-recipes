  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This Chinese Orange Chicken is made with boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into bite-size pieces, dredged, and then fried until golden and crispy. The orange sauce is divine! It is a sweet orange sauce made with orange juice, vinegar, garlic, sugar, soy sauce, ginger, red chili flakes, and orange zest. It is both sweet and spicy and full of flavor.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
<li>2/3 cup (95g) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/3 cup (35g) unsweetened cocoa powder (I use Dutch-processed)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>7 oz. (200g) bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped</li>
<li>2/3 cup (150g) unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
<li>3 large eggs</li>
<li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (175g) granulated sugar</li>
<li>7 oz. (200g) white chocolate chips or chunks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>

    <h3>To make orange sauce:</h3>

    <li>In a medium pot, add orange juice, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and red chili flakes. Heat for 3 minutes.</li>

    <li>In a small bowl, whisk 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 Tablespoons of water to form a paste. Add to orange sauce and whisk together. Continue to cook for 5 minutes, until the mixture begins to thicken. Once the sauce is thickened, remove from heat and add orange zest.</li>

    <h3>To make chicken:</h3>

    <li>Place flour and cornstarch in a shallow dish or pie plate. Add a pinch of salt. Stir.</li>

    <li>Whisk eggs in shallow dish.</li>

    <li>Dip chicken pieces in egg mixture and then flour mixture. Place on plate.
    Heat 2 -3 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Using a thermometer, watch for it to reach 350 degrees.</li>

    <li>Working in batches, cook several chicken pieces at a time. Cook for 2 - 3 minutes, turning often until golden brown. Place chicken on a paper-towel-lined plate. Repeat.</li>

    <li>Toss chicken with orange sauce. You may reserve some of the sauce to place on rice. Serve it with a sprinkling of green onion and orange zest, if so desired.</li>
